I'm excited to share my first project that I've been working on since Aug 2024 to October 2024, the Store POS Management System! 
I built it using C# Windows Forms with MSSQL database. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that helped me grow my skills and really understand the ins and outs of software development.
Through this project, I have gained this knowlegde;

• Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Created classes and objects to represent different components of the system, such as products, purchases, and payment methods.
• C# Windows Forms Development - Learned how to create and manage form controls like, (UserControl, DataGridViews and LisViews) Improved skills in event handling to make the user interface responsive.
• Implementing Key Features - Added features such as product management (adding, editing, deleting products) and handling multiple payment methods (cash, credit card, mobile payments). Implemented a shopping cart system to keep track of items selected for purchase. 
• Problem-Solving Skills - Developed strategies for troubleshooting and resolving issues that arose during development.

As I reflect on this journey, I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge in software development and building upon the strong foundation this project has provided.
